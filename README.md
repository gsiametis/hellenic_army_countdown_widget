This is a very old work I've done while I was spending my compulsory military service in the Hellenic Army and
it's going to be useless for the vast majority out there.
The widget is supposed to run as a widget in MacOS X Dashboard, which is going to be deprecated soon.


It was developed in Dashcode, that has been abandoned by Apple. I'm not sure if there is a way to reuse the project folder as is,
but in any case I've uploaded it.
